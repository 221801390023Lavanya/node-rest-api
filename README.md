# Test GET and POST requests using Postman and analyze HTTP status codes.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This experiment demonstrates how to build a simple *REST API using Express.js, test it using **Postman, and analyze **HTTP status codes* like:

- *200 OK* â†’ Request was successful.  
- *201 Created* â†’ Resource was successfully created.  
- *404 Not Found* â†’ Requested resource does not exist.  

Express.js is a lightweight Node.js framework that makes it easy to build APIs and handle requests. Postman is a tool used to test APIs by sending *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE* and other HTTP requests.
